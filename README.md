# Mastermine
A fully automated mining network for ComputerCraft turtles

Here's all the code for anyone who is interested. It is definitely possible to set up a turtle mining station anywhere on a world with the correct mods installed by changing the coordinates in the config file, however it's not trivial. It took a fair amount of time to get this thing working at all, so I haven't yet taken the additional time to make it easily deployable. For instance, in the original world I had it set up in the orientation of the screen made it so that up was south, and it's still hard coded that way. Maybe if I get some extra time and motivation I'll go back through and make it user friendly.
